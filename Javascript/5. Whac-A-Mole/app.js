// Focus on timing events!
// Overall objective: build a grid that displays a mole in random squares
// If the user clicks on the mole they get a point

// Change the class of one of the squares to 'square mole' directly in the html to see the objective

// Select all the squares and the mole so we can use them in our JS file



// Select the time left and score so we can use them in our JS file
// Use the # selector for elements with an ID



// Initialise the result to 0


// GET THE MOLE TO APPEAR IN A RANDOM SQUARE
let hitPosition;
function randomSquare() {
    // Remove the mole if it exists on any of the squares




    // Add a mole to a random square


    // Everytime you refresh the page you should see the mole in a random square
    // Save the id of the square with the mole (so that we can later use this to see if the user clicks the correct square)

}

// MOVE THE MOLE BETWEEN RANDOM SQUARES
// Create a function that calls the randomSquare function every 500ms
// Use setInterval(function, time)
function moveMole() {

}

// If you load the page you will see the mole jump around in random squares
moveMole();

// INCREMENT THE USERS SCORE
// Each time the user clicks the mole you want to increment the score
squares.forEach(square => {







})

// DECREASE THE TIMER

function countDown() {







}
